Trashweb

A functional web browser implemented as a one line shell script.
This example is taken from ch9 of The Practice of Programming by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike.

This retrieves the web page, discards all of the formatting information, and formats text based on its own rules.

The tcl script fetches the url given by its first argument. Typically produces large amount of output, mostly in the form of html tags bracketed by < and >.
The perl script performs text substitution using regular expressions and substitution to discard the tags.
The awk script fills each output line with at most 60 characters, blank lines cause paragraph breaks.
